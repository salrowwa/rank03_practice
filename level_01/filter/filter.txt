Objective°‧ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 ·｡
Write a program that takes exactly one argument and reads from stdin.  
Your program should output all content from stdin to stdout, replacing every occurrence of the argument with "*" characters of the same length.
The program must handle any buffer size, because the input may be read in random chunk sizes.

Requirements°‧ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 ·｡
1. The program must take exactly one non-empty argument. If called with zero, empty, or multiple arguments, return(1).
2. Read from stdin until EOF.
3. Replace every occurrence of the argument with "*" in the output.
4. Handle memory and read errors.

Examples°‧ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 ·｡
$> echo 'abcdefaaaabcdeabcabcdabc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
***defaaa***de******d***$

$> echo 'ababcabababc' | ./filter ababc | cat -e
